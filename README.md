# 6001CEM_Project_Backend

This project uses Node, NPM and MySQL. Ensure both are installed.

For the database, create a database named 6001CEM in MySQL. The backend uses this to store and retrieve data.

To install all of the project's dependencies, run `npm install`

To seed the database with user accounts, run `npm run refresh_db`

To start the web server, run `node index.js` or `nodemon` if you have the nodemon package installed globally.
